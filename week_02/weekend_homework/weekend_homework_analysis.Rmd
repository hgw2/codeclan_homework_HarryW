# Question 1
Read the cleaned data into R.
```{r}
source("scripts/clean_data_script.R")
meteorite_landings <- read_csv("clean_data/meteorite_landings_clean.csv")
head(meteorite_landings)
```

# Question 2
Find the names and years found for the 10 largest meteorites in the data
```{r}
meteorite_landings %>% 
  filter(fall == "Found") %>% 
  slice_max(mass_g, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE)
```

# Question 3
Find the average mass of meteorites that were recorded falling, vs. those which were just found.


```{r}
meteorite_landings %>% 
  group_by(fall) %>% 
  summarise(avg_mass_g = mean(mass_g))
```

# Question 4
Find the number of meteorites in each year, for every year since 2000

```{r}
meteorite_landings %>% 
  filter(year >= 2000) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(no_of_meteorites_found = n())
```
