You’re going to calculate the conditional probabilities prob( survived ∣ crew ) and prob( survived ∣ passenger ) to settle this dispute.

```{r}
library(prob)
library(gtools)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
titanic <- read_csv("data/titanic.csv")

titanic_passenger <-titanic %>% 
  mutate(passenger_crew = ifelse(str_detect(class, "[0-9]"), "passenger", "crew")) 

#check mutate  worked
titanic_passenger %>%
  filter(!class %in% c("1st", "2nd", "3rd"))
  
```

```{r}
prob_crew_survived <- 
  titanic_passenger %>% 
  filter(passenger_crew == "crew")
```
